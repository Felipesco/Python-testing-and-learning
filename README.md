# Python-testing-and-learning
I'm learning py and doing some tests. “Caramelo” is the name of a personal project, the idea is as follows: More than a virtual assistant, he is a friend.  Please don't judge my code, as I said, I'm still learning.   P.S: I had to delete the other repository due to some errors that I was unable to correct
